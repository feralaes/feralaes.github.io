This course is aimed at students of the Bachelors in Public Policy [(LPP)](https://www.cide.edu/programa/lpp/?seccion=introduccion) who need rigorous knowledge of the theory and and applications of the linear regression model por policy analysis.

Course description
======
The course covers the problems encountered in the analysis of empirical policies and a detailed description of the simple linear model and the multiple linear model, as well as more advanced models that focus on solving estimation problems. The course is organized around different estimation problems that arise in the causal inference for policy analysis and covers, for each problem:
* A description of the problem
* The consequences of the problem
* The linear models used to treat the problem

Course goals and objectives
======
At the end of this course, students must understand and use the linear regression model appropriately. This objective implies understanding and verifying the main econometric assumptions of this model and applying it adequately to economic, public policy or similar problems. Likewise, at the end of the course students must manage the R program and estimate linear regressions in it.
